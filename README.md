# Smarter-Color-Lighting-Standard
An open-source, community-driven standard to offer better, simpler, and more useful "connected" (IoT) color lighting to everyday people.

In 15 years of being an IoT enthusiast, I've tested many connected lighting products.
I started, like many others, with Philips Hue, then went completely DIY with a Raspberry Pi controller,
and later switched to ESP-32 with WLED.

Then I noticed the "Chinese invasion" ;) of cheaper Hue copycat companies transform into the current offer
of really good value products that are now more innovative than the original (Govee, Nanoleaf, Twinkly, Yeelight, etc.).

As a co-owner of a lighting company since 2021, I've also noticed that in the meantime,
the commercial color lighting sector has not evolved as quickly and is still overcomplicated and not as innovative as the consumer market.

While I'm thrilled to see newcomers in the color lighting market arrive with new technology,
I keep coming back to one simple fact—maybe because I'm now a middle-aged man—that regular people don't really care about color lighting ;)
It's nice and impressive when you've just installed your new set of lights for the first time,
but unless it's the holiday season or another festive time (like Halloween), nobody takes the time to change the colors of their setup.

Furthermore, when shopping for a new light, the average Joe sees too many technical specifications and communications protols and standards on the box to know what each really means for them.

However, when I drive near the Champlain Bridge at night (I live near Montreal), I can't help but think that the lighting on this piece of architecture is really cool.

So, I keep asking myself: what would it take for the average Joe to find it worth the trouble to install color lighting on their residence,
and how can we make color lighting much simpler (even for comercial prodcuts).

Enter this new discussion about a possible standard.
