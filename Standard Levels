I think a good starting point would be to have a tiered standard (Level 1, 2, 3) in which Level 3 would be the ultimate goal.
Here are the specifications I was thinking of for each level. Let's discuss, and also keep in mind the ultimate objective is to offer a personalized but super simple experience. Therefore, I think it's important to keep the UX as oriented as possible toward the average Joe. This doesn't mean we can't require manufacturers to offer highly personalizable settings at some levels.


Level 1:

  Hardware:
    Bluetooth provisioning
    Wi-Fi connection
    RGBW
    90% CRI
    600 lm total
    80 lm per watt
    Microphone for sound reaction effects

  Software:
    100 preconfigured scenarios easily programmable for a specific period of the year

  Misc:
    Always prefer indirect lighting (or diffused with 180-degree source) for a less toyish/Las Vegas/gamer style and a more "mature" architectural aesthetic
    Low and subtle effect animation speeds preferred (for the same reasons)


Level 2:

  Hardware:
    Bluetooth provisioning
    Wi-Fi connection
  * RGB+CCT
    90% CRI
  * 800 lm total
  * 100 lm per watt
    Microphone for sound reaction effects

  Software:
  * 200 preconfigured scenarios easily programmable for a specific period of the year
  * Custom-generated scenarios based on consumer preferences
  * Predefined, hyper-calibrated unique color palette

  Misc:
    Always prefer indirect lighting (or diffused with 180-degree source) for a less toyish/Las Vegas/gamer style and a more "mature" architectural aesthetic
    Low and subtle effect animation speeds preferred (for the same reasons)


Level 3:

  Hardware:
    Bluetooth provisioning
    Wi-Fi connection
    RGB+CCT
  * 95% CRI
  * 1000 lm total
  * 120 lm per watt
    Microphone for sound reaction effects

  Software:
  * 300 preconfigured scenarios easily programmable for a specific period of the year
    Custom-generated scenarios based on consumer preferences
    Predefined, hyper-calibrated unique color palette

  Hardware/Software (UX):
  *** Environment aware: the product has access to information about what it's lighting up, to adjust coloration and intensity for every season and weather condition

  Misc:
    Always prefer indirect lighting (or diffused with 180-degree source) for a less toyish/Las Vegas/gamer style and a more "mature" architectural aesthetic
    Low and subtle effect animation speeds preferred (for the same reasons)
